Or in other words, _"what's the least amount of knowledge I need to know in order to be able to read and understand the current literature on GCs?"_

Topics:

* reference counter vs marking/tracing
* conservative GC
* generational GC
* regionalized
* parallel
* concurrent
* incremental

* TLABs
* compaction

* safepoints
* barriers

* object headers

* card tables

types of collectors:
* compacting
* copying

* <isnt there another one?>

* mutator / collector threads
