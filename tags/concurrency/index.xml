      <description>Introduction The goal of this article is to implement a simple Scheduler class, allowing us to both schedule tasks (Runnable instances) that are only to be run once, as well as tasks that can be run repeatedly at a given frequency:
interface Scheduler { public void schedule(LocalDateTime startTime, Runnable runnable); public void schedulePeriodic(LocalDateTime startTime, Duration frequency, Runnable runnable); } There are two possible strategies to design such a scheduler:
  Using condition variables - We store submitted tasks in a tasks priority queue, where tasks are ordered by their schedule date.</description>

      <description>A concurrent blocking queue is a special kind of FIFO data-structure where:
 Calling dequeue() always returns an element, blocking the calling thread if the queue is currently empty. Only an insertion by another thread through a call to enqueue(v) will then unblock it; Calling enqueue() inserts an element in the queue. There are two variants of blocking queues: bounded and unbounded. An unbounded queue allows you to insert as many elements on it as you&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>
